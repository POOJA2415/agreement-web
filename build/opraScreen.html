                    as you receive OPRA Data as a Nonprofessional:
                    <br>
                    <br>(a) You are either a natural person (an individual human being) or a qualifying trust.* You are not a
                    corporation, partnership, limited liability company, or other form of entity(including any form of trust
                    that does not qualify as a qualifying trust). If you agree, click on I AGREE:
                    <br>
                    <br>(b) If you are a natural person, you shall use the OPRA Data solely in connection with your personal
                    investment activities and the personal investment activities of your immediate family members** and qualifying
                    trusts of which you are the trustee or custodian. If you are a qualifying trust, you shall use the OPRA
                    Data solely in connection with your personal investment activities. In any case, you shall not use the
                    OPRA Data in connection with any trade, business, professional or other commercial activities. If you
                    agree, click on I AGREE:
                    <br>
                    <br>(c) You are not a Professional. For a natural person who works in the United States,a Professional is
                    a natural person who is: (i) registered or qualified with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
                    Commodities Futures Trading Commission, any state securities agency, any securities exchange/association,
                    or any commodities/futures contract market/association, (ii) engaged as an investment adviser, as that
                    term is defined in the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (whether or not registered or qualified under
                    that Act); or (iii) employed by a bank or other organization exempt from registration under Federal and/or
                    state securities laws to perform functions that would require you to be so registered or qualified if
                    you were to perform such functions for an organization not so exempt. For a natural person who works
                    outside of the United States, a Professional is a natural person who performs the same functions as someone
                    who would be considered a Professional in the United States. If you agree that you are not a Professional,
                    click on I AGREE:
                    <br>
                    <br>2. You agree to notify Vendor promptly if your circumstances change such that any of the statements in
