                </b> For all purposes of this Agreement, "Market Data" means (a) last sale information and quotation information relating to securities that are admitted to dealings on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE*"), (b) such bond and other equity last sale and quotation information, and such index and other market information, as United States-registered national securities exchanges and national securities associations (each, an "Authorizing SRO") may make available and as the NYSE* may from time to time designate as "Market Data"; and (c) all information that derives from any such information.

Neither
                Subscriber nor any other person shall hold any Disseminating Party liable in any way for (a) any

                or (iii) interruption in any such data, information or message, due either to any
                negligent act or omission by any Disseminating Party, to any "force majeure" (e.g., flood,
                extraordinary weather conditions, earthquake or other act of God, fire, war, insurrection, riot,
                labor dispute, accident, action of government, communications or power failure, equipment or
