                <b>3. Receipt Of Market Data By Subscriber</b>
                <br>
                <br> 3.1 The Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions under which Subscriber may use the Market Data. Subscriber
                acknowledges that, notwithstanding any agreement, CME or Distributor may, in its discretion, discontinue
                disseminating Market Data or change or eliminate its own transmission method, speed or signal characteristics.
                In addition, Subscriber acknowledges and agrees that the Distributor or Exchange reserve the right to disapprove
                any Subscriber and to terminate any Subscriber’s receipt of Market Data for any reason or no reason.
                <br>
                <br> 3.2 (i) Except as provided in section 3.2 (iii) below, Subscriber will use Market Data only for its own
                internal business activities (internal business activities shall exclude subsidiaries and af liates) and
                only at the of ces and locations and on the Devices designated by Subscriber in writing to Distributor and
                CME from time-to-time. (The term “for its own internal business activities,” as used in the immediately preceding
                sentence herein, means for Subscriber’s (a) trading, for its own account or for the account of its customers
                (b) evaluating, for its own internal business decisions or (c) provision of advice to its customers on movements
                or trends in markets for derivative instruments, subject to all of the limitations set forth below in this
                sub-section as to the telephonic disclosure to customers of a necessary and de minimis number of segments
                of Market Data.)
                <br>
                <br> (ii) Subscriber agrees that it will not communicate or otherwise furnish, or permit to be communicated or
                otherwise furnished, the Market Data, in any format, to any other party or any of ce or location other than
                that designated above, nor allow any other party to take, directly or indirectly, any of the Market Data
                from such of ces or locations, and will adopt and enforce any policy that is reasonable to prevent the Market
                Data from being taken therefrom. Subscriber speci cally agrees, without limiting or varying its obligations
                under section 7 herein or otherwise set forth in the Agreement, that Subscriber shall not use or permit another

                from the Market Data, (b) determining or arriving at any price, including any settlement prices, for derivatives
                contracts, options on derivatives contracts, or like derivatives instruments traded on any exchange other
                than the Exchange and (c) for any other derived works that will be disseminated, published or otherwise used
                externally. Subscriber will abide by any other limitations on such use that any of the Exchange may specify
                from time to time. Subscriber will use its best efforts to ensure that its partners, of cers, directors,
                employees and agents maintain sole control and physical possession of, and sole access to, Market Data received
                through Devices in Subscriber’s possession.
                <br>
                <br> (iii) Notwithstanding sections 3.2 (i) and (ii) above, Subscriber may, in the regular course of its business,
                occasionally furnish, to each of its customers and branch of ces, in a quantity restricted to that necessary
                to enable Subscriber to conduct its business, a de minimis number of segments of Market Data, provided that
                such Market Data does not include any OTC Market Data. Such redissemination must be strictly limited to telephonic
                communications not entailing the use of computerized voice synthesization or any other technology and must
                be strictly related to the trading activity of Subscriber or any such recipients. Any such recipients must
                be advised by Subscriber that such segments are proprietary and con dential information not to be disclosed
                or disseminated to other persons or entities. Subscriber agrees to make all reasonable efforts to ensure
                that such recipients abide by the provisions of the Agreement.
                <br>
                <br> (iv) Subscriber will use its best efforts to ensure that no unauthorized dissemination of the Market Data
                is permitted.

                by Subscriber. In addition, at the election of any such Exchange, Subscriber will be liable for the reasonable
                costs of any audit that reveals a discrepancy in such Exchange’s favor of ve percent (5%) or more of the

                following the period to which the records relate. In the event that Subscriber fails to retain such records

                pursuant to any such audit.
