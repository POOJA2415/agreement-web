                <br>
                <br> (i) Supplier made an erroneous initial determination regarding the Subscriber’s qualification;
                <br> (ii) Supplier discovered a misrepresentation herein;
                <br> (iii) the Subscriber failed to furnish all material information; or

                as determined by TSX, during which the Subscriber received Market Data but did not qualify as a Non-Professional
                Subscriber and (iii) of the amount, calculated at in accordance with the fees for professional Subscribers,
                applicable to such period. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of such notice, the Subscriber shall pay such
                amount to TSX.

                <br>

                <br>
                <br> (b) The Subscriber acknowledges and agrees that TSX and/or CEG: (i) have copyright, sui generis and other
